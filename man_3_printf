Printf function is an output function that prints characters to stdout / console / command shell. Printf function returns the number of characters printed to the output file stream(stdout / console / shell).

%d– it is the datatype of the variable that is to be displayed.

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare the variable num.
Step 3: Read input num from the user or can even initialize on your own. 
Step 4:While reading the input from the user use scanf() command to store the value in num.
Step5: To print the value stored in num use printf() command.
Step 6: As per the syntax use the datatype in-place of any and variable name instead of variableOfAnyType.
Step 7: The above step would print the value stored in num.
Step 8: Program end.
